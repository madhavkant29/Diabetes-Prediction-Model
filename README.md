# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project aims to predict whether a patient is at risk of diabetes using machine learning techniques. It uses a Random Forest Classifier model trained on a dataset with various health-related features. The model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, and cross-validation.
